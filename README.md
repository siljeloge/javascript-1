# RainyDays
An e-commerce website for rain jackets, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview
RainyDays is an online store where users can browse products, view product details, and add items to their shopping cart.  
The goal of this project was to practice fundamental front-end development principles regarding JavaScript— building a responsive, accessible, and dynamic shopping experience from scratch.
RainyDays was a project I had when I was learning HTML and CSS. So I built it further with JavaScript later on when I had JS-course.
